description: This project was started with the intent to increase the speed and accuracy of counting large numbers of screws for various projects, as well as reduce the monotony. The project consists of a drum that carries screws into a chute in the back of the body, where a laser and a receiver are placed to count screws as they fall into a container below. The device is powered by an Arduino Nano and coded in Arduino IDE.
