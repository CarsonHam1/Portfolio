description: Designed and built a scale model bridge testing device for use in the Florida Polytechnic University Skills and Design class. The goal was to decrease the time it took to test a student bridge in the class, and provide more accurate data. Key features include automatic failure detection, accurate axial and vertical force readings, and user interface functions to allow students to decide if they would like to test their bridge until catastrophic failure.
